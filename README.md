# Fate Client
Fate Client Is the first ever Internal Legit Client for Minecraft Windows 10 Edition!

## Disclamer:
- This is a hobby project you get what you get.
- I am not responsible for any bans.
- This only works for Minecraft Windows 10 Editon **:o**

## Features:
- Zoom Mod
- Keystrokes
- Coordinates
- CPS Counter
- Unlocked brightness Slider
- Toggle Sprint
- 360 Perspective
- Direction HUD

More to come :)

## Setup:

1. Download Fate Injector [Download](https://github.com/fligger/FateInjector/)
2. Download Fate Client dll and Texture Pack here [releases](https://github.com/fligger/FateClient/releases/)
   - Make sure your game version and your downloaded Fate Client version matches!
   - If not compatible you can downgrade using [McLauncher](https://github.com/MCMrARM/mc-w10-version-launcher)
3. Install the Texture Pack and select it
   - Make sure the Texture Pack is on topmost!
4. Open the injector and press the select button and select the .dll file
5. Hit inject

### The Client is only present for one game session. If you restart the game you have to inject the dll again.

## How to block features: 
0. Make sure you have Injected Fate Client at least once!
1. Open this file Path `%LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe`
2. Navigate into AC -> Fate Client and open the blockConfig.txt
3. Change true statement to false to prevent features from loading
4. Inject the dll Into a fresh game session
   - The state of the blocked module should now say "DISABLED" 

## Troubleshooting:
Dll is injected but nothing happend:
1. Go to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads
2. Scroll down and download the x64: vc_redist.x64.exe
